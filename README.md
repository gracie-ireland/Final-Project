# Final-Project
As a shameless crazy cat lady, I thought it would be fun to create a website to promote the rescue animals I have in care in order to get them adopted into a loving forever family. I foster rescue cats via an animal shelter, so I do intend to use this website to help promote the animals to get them into homes. The homepage will be a short intro as to what being a pet foster carer is, as well as a brief highlight of which kitty/(kitties) are in residence looking for a home! Various links from the homepage may include a full bio of cat(s) in-house, contact page to enquire, donation link for the animal shelter, page to promote adoption as opposed to breeders, how to get involved/volunteer page; and Iâ€™d love to play around with creating an application form for users. Real crazy cat lady stuff... I'm excited!
